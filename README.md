# M1_CALCULATOR_UTILITY
## Description

IT IS A BASIC CALCULATOR FOR NORMAL USE.
WHICH CONTAINS DIFFERENT FEATURE FOR DIFFERENT OPERATION.
IN THIS CALCULATOR YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH KIND OF CALCULATOR YOU WANT TO USE.

### High Level Requirment

You Have Different feature you can choose with.

If want calculate you compound interest or simple interest or simple calculator function.

User Will be able to do these things without any complexity.

#### Low level requirment

user can enter desire data.

Statement of evere line should be clear.

So user can understand each Statement and give input according to Statement.

Calculator Should not give wrong output.
##### 4w's & 1H

@Main Function

Start Program
inputData = Read_Input()
switch
case(1)
choice 1;
(call function)
case(2)
choice 2;
(call function)
.
.
.
default;
@ call first function

declear functions
inputData = Read_Input()
if operator = "+" result = firstNumber + secondNumber

else if operator = "-" result = firstNumber - secondNumber

else if operator = "*" result = firstNumber * secondNumber

else if operator = "/" result = firstNumber / secondNumber

return result
@call secound function

declear functions
inputData = Read_Input()

compound interest=p(1+(r/n))^t

return result;
@call third function

declear functions
inputData = Read_Input()

simple interest= (p*r*t)/100;

return result;


### Expected Behaviour 
 First it will ask you to select a input for selecting a type of calculator.
 
 After Selecting it will ask for choose differnt action that you can choose from.
 
 If you select Simple Calculator you have option to choose +,-,*,'/',^,!.
 
 If you select Simple Interest you have to fill detail about Amount time and rate.
 
 If you select Compound Interest you have to fill detail about Amount time and rate.
